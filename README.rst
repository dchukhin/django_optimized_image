django_optimized_image
======================

django_optimized_image is a simple Django library that allows optimization
of images by using `TinyPNG <https://tinypng.com/>`_ or `Pillow <pillow.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "optimized_image" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'optimized_image',
    ]

2. You have the option to use either TinyPNG or Pillow for optimizing images.
   Inform ``optimized_image`` which one you want to use by setting the following::

    # To use Pillow
    OPTIMIZED_IMAGE_METHOD = 'pillow'
    # To use TinyPNG
    OPTIMIZED_IMAGE_METHOD = 'tinypng'

   Any other string that is set for this setting will mean that optimization does
   not occur. If you are unsure of whether you would like to use TinyPNG or Pillow,
   feel free to consult the documentation of each.

   If you choose to use TinyPNG, you will need to get an API key from
   TinyPNG. Visit https://tinypng.com/developers for more details on getting an
   API key. Once you have done so, add the following setting to your settings
   file. Note: it is a good idea to keep this secret::

    TINYPNG_KEY

3. Migrate the optimized_image models::

    python manage.py migrate optimized_image

4. You may use the ``OptimizedImageField`` by importing it::


    from django.db import models

    from optimized_image.fields import OptimizedImageField


    class MyModel(models.Model):
        ...
        image = OptimizedImageField()

   and saving images into it, the same way you would to a Django ``ImageField``.
   The optimized image will be saved into the ``url`` field in place of the
   unoptimized image.

5. If you want to change legacy models with Django's Image fields and
   optimize the images in those fields, you may do so for legacy models
   by passing a list of legacy model classes (not their instances) to
   the following function::

    from optimized_image.utils import optimize_legacy_images_in_model_fields
    optimize_legacy_images_in_model_fields([LegacyModelClass1, LegacyModelClass2])

   Note: this function makes calls to TinyPNG and S3, so it can take a really
   long time, depending on how many images you have. You may pass in 1
   for the verbosity parameter to get logs on the progress::

    optimize_legacy_images_in_model_fields([LegacyModelClass1, LegacyModelClass2], verbosity=1)

 Note about TinyPNG API keys: If you obtain the free TinyPNG API token, you are limited to 500
 image optimizations per month, so this function may fail if you have a
 lot of images. You may either obtain a paid API key, or wait until next month.
